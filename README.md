USING DENTAL METRICS TO PREDICT GENDER

Overview This project utilizes dental metrics to predict the gender of an individual based on measurements of teeth. It leverages forensic dentistry, which plays a vital role in identifying deceased individuals during natural calamities or other situations where gender determination becomes crucial.


The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.

Project Objective
To analyze dental data and predict gender using machine learning models, based on features like inter-canine distances and other tooth measurements.

Project Architecture
The project follows the following steps:

Raw Data Collection: Collect and load the dataset.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze feature relationships using visualizations.

Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical data and normalize features.

Model Building: Train and test models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation: Assess models using accuracy, ROC curve, and AUC metrics.

Reporting and Documentation: Document insights and outcomes.

Dataset
Target Variable: Gender (Male/Female)
Independent Variables:
Age
Inter-canine distances (intraoral, casts)
Right and left canine casts
Other tooth-related measurements
The dataset is included in the repository as Dentistry.csv.
